# Sage
Sage is a set of tools for Salesforce Marketing Cloud content development, analytics and security.

The goal of this project is to make writing, debugging and analyzing content easier.

## Subscriber Attributes
Subscriber attributes `%%Foo%%`/`[Foo]` are supported through a JSON file named `subscriber.json` in the working directory.

Supported within the JSON file is a key/value pair of the attribute name and value.

Example:
```json
{
    "FirstName": "Logan"
}
```

The attribute values can be referenced via:
```ampscript
%%[
    SET @FIRSTNAME = [FirstName]
]%%

Hello %%=V(@FIRSTNAME)=%%
or
Hello %%FirstName%%
```

## Referencing Content
Content functions can reference content local on disk.  The files must exist in a `Content` subdirectory of the working directory.

Example, if you have a file at `Content\EmbeddedContent.ampscript`, then you can reference it via:
```ampscript
%%=CONTENTBLOCKBYNAME("EmbeddedContent")=%%
```

## Data Extensions
Data Extension support is provided through CSV files on disk.  The files must exist in a `DataExtensions` subdirectory of the working directory. The CSV file must contain headers which represent the columns.

Example, if you have a file at `DataExtensions\Loyalty.csv`, then it will use this CSV file as the data extension.

`DataExtensions\Loyalty.csv`
```csv
EmailAddress,SubscriberKey,FirstName,LastName,LoyaltyLevel
donnie@northerntrailoutfitters.com,1,Donnie,Stanton,Silver
```

`Index.ampscript`
```ampscript
Hello %%=LOOKUP("Loyalty", "FirstName", "emailAddress", "donnie@northerntrailoutfitters.com")=%%
```

Outputs:
```ampscript
Hello Donnie
```
